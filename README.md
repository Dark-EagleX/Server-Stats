# Server Stats

A bot that counts the number of members in a server
See [here](https://github.com/ERmilburn02/server-stats/tree/37be6d67e2662678c7c022947b970ce82f20d05f) for all the code that was made during the original hour.

## Adding the bot to your server

I NO LONGER HOST THE BOT! IF YOU WANT IT IN YOUR SERVER, PLEASE HOST IT YOURSELF!

## Self-hosting the bot

If you want to run the bot for yourself, then you need [Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/). Just add your bot token to `Settings.json` and then run the following commands:

```
npm i
node .
```

and the bot will run.

## Using the bot

Once the bot is in your server, run the following command:

```
.setchannel <ID>
```

where `<ID>` is the ID of the voice channel.
